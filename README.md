# RockBottom
WiCHacks 2022 Project - a platformer game that is centered around the story of a pet rock

## Description
This is a 2D platformer game that we created with Pygame and Pygame_Gui.

## Inspiration
We knew that we wanted to do a game since when we saw the categories, since it is something that none of us have ever done throughly before. 
We asked our friends for ideas, and we came up with a story of a pet rock that gets dropped into a drain and has to find their way back home 
to its owner. 

The beauty of making games is being able to tell a story in most interactive form. Using our creativity, we wanted to recreate our fond memories 
of the simple times when all we worried about was taking care of our pet rocks.

## What it does
This two-level platformer game is exactly that. The player plays as our main character, a pet rock, as they travel through different ecosystems. 

## How we built it
We built this entirely in python, using the python games api: pygame. 

## Challenges we ran into
- Game Physics
- Collision (Many, many bugs...)
- Camera Scrolling 
- Moving Platforms

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We're proud of being able to complete a whole game in just 24 hours!

## What we learned
We learned about python, using APIs, and we learned a lot about game design. 

## What's next for Rock Bottom
We actually drafted two additional levels, that we hope to implement in the future. 
- Additional Levels
- Collectibles
- Lives/Checkpoints
